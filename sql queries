Query 1:
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

Query 2: This query returns the first 100 taxi trips where pickup and drop-off happen in the same zone, along with that zone’s info.
SELECT *
FROM yellow_taxi_data y, zones z
WHERE 
y."PULocationID" = z."LocationID" AND
y."DOLocationID"=  z."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

Query 3: Inner Join
SELECT *
FROM yellow_taxi_data y INNER JOIN zones z
ON
y."PULocationID" = z."LocationID" AND
y."DOLocationID"=  z."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

Query 4: Checking for Location IDs in the zones table not in the yellow taxi table
SELECT DISTINCT y."PULocationID"
FROM yellow_taxi_data y
WHERE y."PULocationID" NOT IN (SELECT "LocationID" FROM zones)
LIMIT 100;

Query 5: This helps find old zone IDs not used in January 2021.
SELECT DISTINCT z."LocationID"
FROM zones z
WHERE z."LocationID" NOT IN (SELECT "PULocationID" FROM yellow_taxi_data);

Query 6: Keeps all rows from taxi table, even if zone doesn’t exist:(left join)-->Left Join
SELECT *
FROM yellow_taxi_data y
LEFT JOIN zones z
ON y."PULocationID" = z."LocationID";

Query 7: Keeps all rows from zones-->Right Join
SELECT *
FROM yellow_taxi_data y
RIGHT JOIN zones z
ON y.PULocationID = z.LocationID;

Query 8: Keeps both-->Full Join
SELECT *
FROM yellow_taxi_data y
FULL OUTER JOIN zones z
ON y."PULocationID" = z."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

Query 9:Group BY
SELECT DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS day,
       COUNT(*) AS trips
FROM yellow_taxi_data
GROUP BY day;

Query 10: Order BY
SELECT day, trips
FROM (
    SELECT DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS day,
           COUNT(*) AS trips
    FROM yellow_taxi_data
    GROUP BY day
) t
ORDER BY trips DESC;

Query 11: Aggregations
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_trips,
    MIN(tpep_pickup_datetime),
    MAX(tpep_pickup_datetime)
FROM yellow_taxi_data;
